# Simon Game
This is a simulated Simon Game created as per the instructions on freeCodeCamp for the legacy Front End Developer Certificate. The game will present the user with a randomly generate pattern and the user has to repeat the pattern. The game will end after a count of 20. There is a strict mode that resets the pattern if the user repeats the pattern incorrectly.

There is a working version of this repo at the following link: [Simon Game](https://codepen.io/noctearmy/pen/qYPVMx)
